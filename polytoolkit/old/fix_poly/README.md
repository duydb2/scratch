fix_poly

small program based on the 'prepair' application 
(https://github.com/tudelft-gist/prepair) to:

* take invalid polygons
* convert them into valid multipolygons
* triangulate them (naively w/ duplicate verts for now)
* export them to *.ply format

depends: prepair,cgal,gdal/ogr,boost,poly2tri,rply,stl
